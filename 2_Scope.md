# Scope

This working group focuses on creating a specification for raw power system data, usually retrieved from Power System Operators.

Power System data might include, but is not limited to:

- Power generation emissions
- Delivery capacities and/or constraints
- Generation mix
- Power imports and exports
- Power market data

This common standard shall facilitate a systematic and more accurate approach to report grid emissions. It should further enable grid decarbonisation pathways and decision-making.
