# Scope

This working group focuses on creating a standardised data structure to ingest raw power system data.

Power system data is usually provided by, but is not limited to, distribution and transmission power system operators. Power System data might include, but is not limited to:

- Power generation emissions
- Delivery capacities and/or constraints
- Generation mix
- Power imports and exports
- Power market data
- Contractual data

This common data structure shall facilitate a systematic and more accurate approach to account for grid emissions. It should further enable grid decarbonisation pathways and decision-making.

Any changes of Scope are not retroactive.
