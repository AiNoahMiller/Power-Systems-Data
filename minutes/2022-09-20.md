## Minutes

* Maintainer transition

  * A bit of context has been lost in the way, but this change could kickstart a new phase of the WG.

* Point on data types proposal.
  * Quick review of the documents that have been created as final proposals to be reviewed.

* Update on outreach to MISO and ENTSO-E for proposals review
  * No answer so far. Pierre Segonne will reach out again to ENTSO-E (already did) and recontact Jeff Burka (Singularity) together with Nathalie Winters (MISO).

* Open discussion around the low level of activity within the working group.
  * The new maintainer will send an agenda before the meeting
  * The new maintainer will publish minutes of the meetings, and potentially record meetings to allow those that did not make it to catch up.
  * The new maintainer will discuss with the steering group to ask for more contributors.
